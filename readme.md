## Social Analysis on DeviantART

This is a social analysis study on [deviantART.com](http://www.deviantart.com/).
Goal was to find effect of _follow_ connection on the network and to classify important nodes. Detection of the most influential users has a lot of practical applications such as predicting the prices of the artworks.

It was a part of my bachelor final project.
